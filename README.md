# etch-a-sketch

## About

> In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a Javascript powered "Etch-A-Sketch." As the user hovers their mouse pointer over the grid of generated squares, they will highlight and change color. This exercise is intended to further strengthen JS skills.
